Automated deployment and lifecycle management of AppDynamics Smart Agent across multiple EC2 hosts using GitHub Actions with a self-hosted runner.

## üéØ Overview

This lab demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to manage AppDynamics Smart Agent and various AppDynamics agents (Node, Machine, DB, Java) across multiple Ubuntu EC2 instances within a single AWS VPC. The project includes 11 automated workflows covering the complete agent lifecycle.

**Key Features:**
- üöÄ **Parallel Deployment** - Deploy to multiple hosts simultaneously
- üîÑ **Complete Lifecycle Management** - Install, uninstall, stop, and clean agents
- üèóÔ∏è **Infrastructure as Code** - All workflows version-controlled
- üîê **Secure** - SSH key-based authentication, private VPC networking
- üìà **Massively Scalable** - Deploy to thousands of hosts with automatic batching
- üéõÔ∏è **Self-hosted Runner** - Executes within your AWS VPC

## üìä Architecture

All infrastructure runs in a single AWS VPC with a shared security group. The self-hosted runner communicates with target hosts via private IPs.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS VPC with EC2 instances (Ubuntu)
- Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner in the same VPC
- SSH key pair for authentication
- AppDynamics Smart Agent package and config

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chambear2809/github-actions-lab.git
cd github-actions-lab
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up GitHub Secrets

Navigate to: **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**

**Required Secret:**
- `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - Your SSH private key (PEM format)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up GitHub Variables

Navigate to: **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Variables**

**Required Variable:**
- `DEPLOYMENT_HOSTS` - Target host IPs (one per line)
  ```
  172.31.1.243
  172.31.1.48
  172.31.1.5
  ```

**Optional Variables:**
- `SMARTAGENT_USER` - User for Smart Agent service (e.g., `appdynamics`)
- `SMARTAGENT_GROUP` - Group for Smart Agent service (e.g., `appdynamics`)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy!

**Via GitHub UI:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select **"Deploy Smart Agent"**
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Optionally adjust batch size (default: 256)
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

**Via GitHub CLI:**
```bash
gh workflow run "Deploy Smart Agent" --repo chambear2809/github-actions-lab

# With custom batch size
gh workflow run "Deploy Smart Agent" --repo chambear2809/github-actions-lab -f batch_size=128
```

## üìã Available Workflows

### Deployment (1 workflow)
| Workflow | Description | Scale | Trigger |
|----------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Deploy Smart Agent (Batched)** | Installs Smart Agent and starts service | Any | Manual only |

### Agent Installation (4 batched workflows)
| Workflow | Command | Scale | Trigger |
|----------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Install Node Agent (Batched)** | `smartagentctl install node` | Any | Manual only |
| **Install Machine Agent (Batched)** | `smartagentctl install machine` | Any | Manual only |
| **Install DB Agent (Batched)** | `smartagentctl install db` | Any | Manual only |
| **Install Java Agent (Batched)** | `smartagentctl install java` | Any | Manual only |

### Agent Uninstallation (4 batched workflows)
| Workflow | Command | Scale | Trigger |
|----------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Uninstall Node Agent (Batched)** | `smartagentctl uninstall node` | Any | Manual only |
| **Uninstall Machine Agent (Batched)** | `smartagentctl uninstall machine` | Any | Manual only |
| **Uninstall DB Agent (Batched)** | `smartagentctl uninstall db` | Any | Manual only |
| **Uninstall Java Agent (Batched)** | `smartagentctl uninstall java` | Any | Manual only |

### Smart Agent Management (2 batched workflows)
| Workflow | Description | Scale | Trigger |
|----------|-------------|-------|----------|
| **Stop and Clean Smart Agent (Batched)** | Stops service and purges data | Any | Manual only |
| **Cleanup All Agents (Batched)** | Deletes /opt/appdynamics directory | Any | Manual only |

**Total: 11 workflows** - All batched workflows support configurable batch sizes (default: 256)

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Developer** pushes code or manually triggers a workflow
2. **GitHub Actions** receives the event and assigns job to self-hosted runner
3. **Runner** loads target hosts from GitHub variables
4. **Parallel Execution** - Runner SSHs into each target host simultaneously
5. **Commands Execute** - Install/uninstall/stop/clean operations run on each host
6. **Results Reported** - Success/failure status sent back to GitHub

## üîê Security

- **Private Network** - All communication via VPC private IPs
- **SSH Keys** - Stored securely as GitHub secrets
- **No Public Access** - Target hosts don't need public IPs
- **Security Group** - Restricts SSH access to runner only

## üìà Scaling

All workflows use automatic batching to support any number of hosts:

### How It Works
- **Automatic batching** - Splits hosts into groups of 256 (configurable)
- **Sequential batch processing** - Avoids overwhelming runner resources
- **Parallel within batch** - Each batch processes all hosts simultaneously
- **Works at any scale** - 1 host to thousands

### Batching Strategy
1. Splits your host list into manageable batches
2. Processes each batch as a separate job sequentially
3. Deploys to all hosts within each batch in parallel using background processes

**Examples:**
- **10 hosts** = 1 batch, all deploy in parallel
- **500 hosts** = 2 batches √ó 256 hosts
- **1,000 hosts** = 4 batches √ó 256 hosts
- **5,000 hosts** = 20 batches √ó 256 hosts
